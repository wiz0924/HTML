    <h1 class="title">Portfolio #4 - Computer Hardware and Software: Their Implementation in the Different Institutions in the Community</h1>
    <h2 class="section-title">What is Computer Hardware?</h2>
    <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Computer hardware is all the physical parts of a computer, distinguished by the data that resides in it or that operates in it, and software that provides hardware creation instructions to complete its task. (Romadhona & Asbari, 2022)</li>
        <li>Computer hardware is the physical components that make up a computer system and enable it to perform essential functions, such as input, output, processing and storage. (Susnjara & Smalley, 2025)</li>
        <li>These parts are the foundation of a computer and are an integral necessity for its operation. The significance of computer hardware cannot be understated. It serves as the platform on which software and applications operate, enabling us to execute many types of tasks on our computers. Without hardware, a computer program would be useless, unable to process information, store data, or display output. (Lanni, 2024)</li>
        <li>The computer hardware system is the general name of the actual physical device in the computer system, which can be electronic, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, light elements or devices, and is the physical housing of GIS.(Nema, 2012)</li>
        <li>The definition of Hardware or in Indonesian is also known as the name hardware is one of the components of a computer whose properties can be seen and touched directly or in a tangible form, which functions to support the computerization process. (Agus Purwanto & Tawar, 2024)</li>

    <h2 class="section-title">What is Computer Software and its types?</h2>
    <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Software is a set of instructions that operate computers and execute tasks. The software serves various purposes like collecting and saving critical corporate data, performing many actions, and streamlining business operations. (Christian, 2022)</li>
        <li>Software denotes computer programs, including operating systems, utilities, tools, database management systems, and programs for end users. (Ferguson & Hebels, 2003)</li>
        <li>While software is itself non-physical and intangible, a principal goal for instances of the type software is for them to contain one or more components whose execution effects the management and control of tangible entities. Computer software is characterized by the fact that it is intended to execute on a computer. (Osterweil, 2008)</li>
        <li>In a computer system, the software is basically a set of instructions or commands that tell a computer to do a specific task that serves its users. A software is not a physical thing like hardware, it rather makes the hardware work as per user requirements by giving instructions. (GeeksforGeeks, 2021)</li>
        <li>Two broad categories based on Purpose, System Software and Application Software.
            <br>System Software: -Provides platform to other software programs.
            <br>Application Software: -A computer program designed to perform a specific task or a group of coordinated tasks. (Ali & Ali, 2018)</li>

    <h2 class = "section-title">Analysis/Reaction</h2>
    <p>After researching and creating this portfolio, I had many learnings and realizations. To start, I realized that while computer hardware and software are always mentioned together, their roles and importance can actually be appreciated separately. Hardware refers to the tangible, physical components of a computer system. It is the foundation, since without hardware, software cannot be executed or applied to real-world tasks. On the other hand, software is the set of intangible instructions that give life to hardware by telling it what to do. These two are inseparable, yet they contribute differently in ensuring that computers function in our daily lives. Hardware provides the platform, while software provides the logic and purpose.</p>
    <p>However, more than the definitions, what impressed me the most is how hardware and software are applied in various institutions in the community. For example, in healthcare, they are used to record and access patient health information, prescribe medications, and store medical data electronically. In government, hardware and software power digital registration processes and enable services to be integrated into platforms like the eGov PH Super App. Banking institutions rely heavily on the integration of servers, client devices, and applications to provide secure online banking services. In manufacturing, specialized software streamlines the entire production process by enhancing efficiency and accuracy, while in retail, management systems help with stock control, payment processing, and customer engagement. These examples showed me that hardware and software are not just technical ideas, but real tools used in the daily operations of the institutions we rely on.</p>
    <p>From this activity, I learned that hardware and software complement one another, and both are essential in modern life. Their implementation across the various institutions not only enhances efficiency but also transforms the way these institutions serve people. The activity gave me a broader understanding of how IT resources are applied in the community and reaffirmed the fact that hardware and software are at the core of digital transformation. In the end, we can conclude that both hardware and software are crucial components for the growth, innovation, and efficiency in every sector of society.</p>
