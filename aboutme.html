            <p class="description">Hello! I am Keith Andre D. Zanoria, currently a freshman at the University of San Carlos pursuing BS Information Technology. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always been fascinated by technology, which naturally led me to choosing this field.
            <br><br>
                I’m still fairly new to web development, but I have hands-on experience with C++, Arduino, mBlock, and even a bit of soldering. I enjoy building things, experimenting with code, and learning how different technologies work together.
            <br><br>
                Outside the university, I’m the type of student who puts the athlete before the student. I love playing basketball (even if I’m vertically challenged) and I enjoy running. As I like to joke: “If the code doesn’t run, I will.”
            <br><br>
                This is my first website, and I’m excited to share my work as I continue to grow in this field. Feel free to explore, and thank you for visiting!
