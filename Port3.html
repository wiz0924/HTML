        <h2 class="section-title">What are Number Systems?</h2>
        <p class="info">Number systems are systems in mathematics that are used to express numbers in various forms and are understood by computers. In addition, there are different types of number systems that we use such as the binary number system, the octal number system, the decimal number system, and the hexadecimal number system.

<h2 class="section-title">Analysis/Reaction</h2>
<div class = "info">
<p>The planet is a vast place with many countries, each with diverse cultures and languages. However, there is one concept that remains universal across the world, numbers. </p>
<p><br>In this portfolio, we talk about number systems and its different types which are: Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal.</p>
<p><br>For everyday tasks, the go-to number system has always been the Decimal number system which uses digits 0-9. It is what is used in basic arithmetic, finance, and scientific calculations. On the other hand, we have the other number systems which are not commonly used but are applied in specific fields specially in computer systems. First is Binary, it is the most fundamental number system and it is the language that the computer can understand directly, everything that we input goes through the process of turning into a binary for the computer to interpret it. Next is Octal which is basically a simpler way of writing binary numbers as it is a collection of 3 bits per digit. This allows for readability and accuracy. Lastly, we have Hexadecimal which is similar to Octal but of higher value. To compare, Octal holds/represents 3 bits per digit, while Hexadecimal holds/represents 4 bits per digit. This means that Hexadecimal is more efficient than octal because each digit represents four bits, allowing large binary values to be written compactly. However, because it uses letters A–F, beginners may find it slightly confusing at first.</p>
<p><br>In summary, it is obvious that among the different types of number systems, Decimal is most used. However, this does not entail that the others are irrelevant as they are applied in various fields that are essential to the world today. The average population may not use the different number systems, but to us who are in the field of technology, each one is just as important as the other.</p>
