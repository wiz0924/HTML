    <h2 class="section-title">Data and Information</h2>
    <ul class="info-list">
            <li>Data are the basic individual items of numeric or other information, garnered through observation; but in themselves, without context, they are devoid of information. Information is that which is conveyed, and possibly amenable to analysis and interpretation, through data and the context in which the data are assembled.(Zins, 2007)</li>
            <li>Data refers simply to raw facts and figures. Alone it tells you nothing. The real goal is to turn data into information. Data becomes information when it’s presented in a context so that it can answer a question or support decision making (Emese Felvegi et al., 2020)</li>
            <li>Data is defined as a value or set of values representing a specific concept or concepts. Data become 'information' when analyzed and possibly combined with other data in order to extract meaning, and to provide context. (Glossary: Data vs. Information, 2025)</li>
            <li>Data is a raw form of information without proper meaning or usefulness unless it is processed and transformed into meaningful forms. On the other hand, information is a processed form of data developed or formed to arrive at a particular decision or to use in making some decisions. (What Is Data and Information? Their Difference Explained, 2025)</li>
            <li>Data are recorded (captured and stored) symbols and signal readings. Information is a message that contains relevant meaning, implication, or input for decision and/or action. (Liew, 2007)</li>
        </ul>


    <h2 class="section-title">Information Systems</h2>
    <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Information systems function in an organized and interactive manner to collect data pertaining to individuals and job roles within educational institutions, storing, analyzing, and interpreting this data with the aim of transforming it into informative reports.(Al-Twijri et al., 2024)</li>
        <li>Information systems are interrelated components working together to collect, process, store, and disseminate information to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis, and viualization in an organization. (Bourgeois & Bourgeois, 2014)</li>
        <li>An information system (IS) is a set of interrelated components that collect, manipulate, store and disseminate information and provide a feedback mechanism to achieve a goal. The feedback mechanism helps organizations achieve their goals by increasing profits, improving customer service [3], and supporting decision-making and control in organizations (Zemmouchi-Ghomari, 2021)</li>
        <li>Information Systems (IS) is the study of how people, technology, and processes work together to collect, process, and store information that supports decision-making and control within an organization.(Contributors, 2024)</li>
        <li>In a narrow sense, the term information system (or computer-based information system) refers to the specific application software that is used to store data records in a computer system and automates some of the information-processing activities of the organization.(Paul, 2025)</li>

    <p class = "leavitt">Leavitt’s Diamond model of change management is a framework that provides a holistic approach to managing change within an organization. <br><br>Developed by Harold J. Leavitt in the 1960s, the model recognizes that successful change requires consideration of four key elements: people, tasks, structure, and technology. <br><br>The model suggests that changes made to any one of these elements will have a direct impact on the others, and that managing change effectively requires a balance between them.</p>

        <div class="overlay">
            <p>When decisions are unclear or involve many moving parts, organizations use decision support systems (DSS) to help them think through the possibilities. They often combine internal data with external sources, including market trends, competitor activity, regulatory updates, and economic forecasts.</p>

<h2 class="analysistitle">Analysis/Reaction</h2>
<div class = "analysis">
<p>Data and Information, when looked upon from the bigger picture, sounds similar. However, after the research and reading that I have done for this activity, I have come to realize that they are quite different but still related. Data is raw figures or facts which do not make any sense as they have no context. In contrast, information is a processed form of data, which users can now understand, interpret, and analyze in order to answer questions or support decision making. Both are equally important  in the bigger picture. Data by itself is irrelevant as there is nothing that we can understand from raw words or numbers. On the other hand, information also cannot exist without data itself.</p>
<p>In addition to data and information, this activity also covered Information Systems (IS). From what I have understood, it is basically a set of interrelated components that work together to collect, store, process, and circulate information that are relevant and essential for businesses or any organization in general. This information is then used for wise decision making and proper control of important assets for the organization. Information Systems are essential to any modern business as it enables efficient and smooth operations. A business with no IS application whatsoever is sure to be behind those that have them, thus emphasizing the importance of Information Systems in today’s world.</p>
<p>Lastly, the types of support systems in Information Systems. From my prior readings, I have identified 4 main types, Transaction Processing System, Management Information System, Decision Support System, and Executive Information System. However, upon further research, I was able to identify 4 more, namely: Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, Supply Chain Management, Knowledge Management System. The first four are the original and have a hierarchy which can be represented as a triangle. TPS is at the bottom, as it is for day-to-day processes. Above it is the MIS, which takes data from the TPS and uses it to help mid-level managers to track or monitor current progress. Third on the triangle is the DSS, which is used by senior managers to solve problems, make decisions, and project future outcomes for the business. Lastly, at the top of the pyramid is the EIS, which executives use to guide the entire organization onto the right path. In addition to the 4 traditional systems, we also have 4 modern ones. First is the ERP, which brings all processes into a single unified platform. Next is the CRM, and as its name suggests, its function is to help strengthen customer-business relationships. Then we have the SCM, which manages the flow of goods from suppliers to customers. And lastly, the KMS, which allows employees to share valuable information and knowledge with others.</p>
<p>In summary, a lot of things were learned in creating this portfolio. It helped me grasp new concepts and strengthen my knowledge on the things that I knew beforehand. Ultimately, we can conclude that Information Systems are important in the operations and existence of businesses and organizations.</p>
