        <p>Throughout this course, I gained a deeper understanding of how technology works behind the scenes, but the most meaningful part of my experience was creating this website. It was my first time building a site completely from scratch, and I can honestly say that I learned far more than I expected. I started with no knowledge of web development, yet through constant practice, experimentation, trial and error, and curiosity, I managed to teach myself the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
            <br><br>The process was not easy. There were moments of confusion, broken layouts, and code that simply refused to work. But every challenge pushed me to search for solutions, try new approaches, and slowly understand how everything fits together. Watching my website take shape piece by piece was both rewarding and motivating, and it helped me appreciate how powerful, logical, and creative web development can be.
            <br><br>This project also made me realize that I still have a long way to go. There is so much more to learn and so many skills left to improve. Instead of discouraging me, this excites me even more. Knowing that there is still so much potential ahead motivates me to keep growing and pushing myself further. The experience I gained here will definitely be valuable for future projects and opportunities.
            <br><br>Overall, this project wasn’t just about creating a website, it was about shaping my future. It sparked a genuine interest in web development and made me curious about what else the field has to offer. With hard work, perseverance, and a willingness to keep learning, I believe the sky is the limit. I look forward to what lies ahead and to the many possibilities waiting for me in the world of technology.
