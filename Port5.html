    <h2 class="section-title">What are Motherboards?</h2>
        <div class="info-list">
        <li>A motherboard is the primary circuit board connecting all the necessary pieces for your computer to operate as a system.(What Is a Motherboard?, 2023)</li>
        <li>A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer. The motherboard is a computer's central communications backbone connectivity point, through which all components and external computer hardware connect. (Kirvan, 2022)</li>
        <li>Essentially, the motherboard is what makes a functioning computer as it is what connects everything together and makes the computer a system. Without it, you just have separate useless electronic parts. </li>

        <div class="info-list">
        <p>Like humans, motherboards have also been evolving and upgrading over the years. Each new version offering better performance and functionality than the last. In this portfolio, we conduct a comparison on the different types of motherboards, both old and new. Through this portfolio, we will be able understand how tech companies have innovated and improved motherboard designs in order to cater to ever-changing preference and needs of users.</p>
        <p><br>Motherboards serve as the backbone for computer systems. It is the main circuit board in a computer system as it connects all of the internal components, like the memory, processor, graphics card and other hardware (Lenovo, 2021). Which basically means that determine the functionality and overall performance of a computer. Over time, motherboards have evolved in terms of build, CPU and memory slots, chipsets, and etc. </p>
        <p><br>Over time, we have had various types of motherboards such as: AT, Standard-ATX/ATX, BTX, Extended-ATX, LPX, Micro-ATX, Mini ITX, Mini-ATX,  and Pico BTX. Each of these motherboards represents the eras and breakthroughs that motherboards have had over the years. They all vary in their sizes, slots, functionality, features, and etc. For example, older models like the AT and LPX motherboards were large, making them inefficient and impractical for modern computing needs. On the other hand, the Standard ATX, Extended-ATX, and Micro-ATX, are the standards right now due to their efficiency and viability. These types are balanced in every aspect, making them ideal choices for completing modern tasks. Meanwhile, the Mini-ITX and Pico-BTX are made for more compact and minimalist build in order to save space, while still having essential features. Despite being different and unique from one another, each type exists in order to meet the needs and preferences of users. May it be for high-performance tasks such as gaming or for simple day to day tasks.  This wide variety of choices allows users to pick which one suits them most. </p>
        <p><br>All in all, the different types of motherboards reflect their evolution over time in order to adapt to the growing demands of users. As time goes on, we will be able to see even more variations of these motherboards. This will not only enhance the performance of computers as a whole, but also showcase the innovation of man in the world of computing.</p>
