        <div class = "texts">
        <p class = "text-block"> Today, technology is an integral part of our daily lives. Computers, along with the various fields and disciplines that encompass it are evidently present and essential for almost everything present around us. One of the disciplines that is more widely known and established is Computer Science. It deals with theories, algorithms, computations, and many others. In addition, despite it being known for delving more on the theoretical aspects of computers, it actually also covers both software and hardware. However, after a little bit of research and reading, 
            I discovered that despite Computer Science being its own independent field now, it was once a debated topic as to what it really was before. According to a report by Denning (1989), computing had 3 major paradigms: theory, abstraction/science, and engineering.
            <br><br> Theory is centered on mathematical methods in the development of valid theories. Abstraction on the other hand is on the scientific and experimental side. Lastly, the engineering paradigm is more on building and testing systems to solve problems. A statement from a study by Clark (2003) encapsulates the topic simply, “Another reason why computer scientists may disagree on the nature of the discipline relates to the way in which it has expanded over time”. Since then, computing has grown exponentially, leading to the development of the different fields we have now such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and many more. 
            <br><br> Moving on to the current state of computing, there are 5 main disciplines. Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT), Information Systems (IS), Computer Engineering (CE), Software Engineering (SE). Each of these disciplines are relevant in their own right, and although unique and distinct, work hand in hand in the development of anything tech-related. As defined by Courte and Bishop-Clark (2009): </p> 
        
        <ul class="list"> 
            <li>“<strong>Computer Science</strong> is the study and the science of theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems” which people say is the most theoretical discipline. </li> 
            <li>“<strong>Information Technology</strong> as an academic discipline focuses on meeting the needs of users through the selection, creation, integration and deployment of computing technology”. </li> 
            <li>“<strong>Information Systems</strong> programs study information systems and their use in business and other organizations”, making it the most business oriented among the 5 disciplines. </li> 
            <li>“<strong>Computer Engineering</strong> encompasses broad areas of both electrical engineering and computer science”, and is the most hardware oriented out of all disciplines.</li> 
            <li>“<strong>Software Engineering</strong> is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software.”.</li> 
        </ul> 
        
        <p class = "text-block"> These 5 are the main computing disciplines, each having a role of its own. Whether it be hardware and software development, or product deployment and maintenance. A realization that occurred to me in conducting this research is the fact of how broad computing really is. From being a debated topic of being a legitimate discipline to now being established and even having branches of its own.</p>
