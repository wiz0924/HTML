<section>
            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                In this portfolio, we dive into the different types of computers in the modern world. Ranging from the biggest and fastest supercomputers, down to the very desktops and cellphones, or the so-called microcomputers that we own. Each type of computer serves a unique purpose and plays an important role in our daily lives, whether it's performing complex scientific calculations, running businesses, or simply helping us stay connected and entertained.

        <h2 class="section-title">Discussion</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">
            The word “computer” is one of the most inventions in human history. It has completely changed the way things are processed, from science and mathematics, down to the everyday tasks and actions that we do. Although if we would ask people what a computer is, the first thing that would come to mind would be the typical desktop or PC (Personal Computer). So what really is a computer? 
            <br><br>A computer is an electronic device that can be programmed to process data and produce specific outputs. It can respond to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and execute programs, which are sequences of instructions that tell it what to do. Computers come in all shapes and sizes, from the one on your desk to the one in your pocket. (Beal, 2024)
            <br><br>As what Beal said, computers come in all shapes and sizes. There are various types, each serving a different and unique purpose than the other. In this discussion, we name 6 types of computers:  supercomputers, mainframe computers, minicomputers, servers, workstations, and microcomputers.
        </p>

        <ul class="info-list">
            <li><strong>Supercomputers</strong> – The fastest and most powerful type of computer, used for research, weather forecasting, and complex scientific studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Mainframe Computers</strong> – Large and powerful systems used by big companies and organizations to process and store massive amounts of data, such as in banking or government institutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Minicomputers</strong> – Mid-sized computers that were once used by smaller businesses or departments for specific tasks, offering a balance between performance and cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Servers</strong> – Computers that manage network resources and deliver data or services to other computers, commonly used in businesses, websites, and data centers.</li>
            <li><strong>Workstations</strong> – High-performance computers designed for professionals working in fields like engineering, design, and animation, where heavy computing power is needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Microcomputers</strong> – Also known as personal computers, these are the most common type used today for everyday tasks like schoolwork, gaming, and communication.</li>
        </ul>

                        A supercomputer is defined as an extremely powerful computing device that processes data at speeds measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) to perform complex calculations and simulations, usually in the field of research, artificial intelligence, and big data computing.

                    <p class="desc">
                    Mainframe, also known as big iron, is a high-performance computer used for large-scale, compute-intensive purposes and tasks that require greater availability and security than smaller-scale machines. (Kirvan, 2023)
                    <br><br>At their core, mainframes are high-performance computers with large amounts of memory and data processors that process billions of simple calculations and transactions in real-time. A mainframe computer is critical to commercial databases, transaction servers and applications that require high resiliency, security and agility.                     </p>

                    A minicomputer is a type of computer that is smaller than a mainframe but bigger than a personal computer. It can handle multiple tasks and serve several users at once. Mini computers are often used in small businesses or research labs for tasks like data processing. They are more affordable and compact compared to larger computers, making them a popular choice for many industries. (WP Blog, 2025)

                    A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.
